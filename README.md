# NREL Solar Data App

With this Matlab app it is possible to access the solar data in the NREL database. The app is based on the NREL API and the user can access the data by selecting the location. The solar data for the selected location is then displayed in a graph. The user can also download the data in a csv file.

## Usage

To use the app, the user needs to have a NREL API key. The key can be obtained by registering at the NREL website<sup>1,2</sup>. The key needs to be entered in the app before the data can be accessed. Also an OpenWeatherMap<sup>3</sup> API key is needed to access location data. The key can be obtained by registering at the OpenWeatherMap website. The key needs to be entered in the app before the weather data can be accessed.
